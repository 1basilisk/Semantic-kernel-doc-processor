Harry attends Hogwarts School, befriends Ron and Hermione, and confronts Voldemort's attempt to regain power through the Philosopher's Stone.

In the second book, Harry's second year at Hogwarts involves mysterious attacks linked to the Chamber of Secrets, which Harry eventually uncovers and destroys, saving Ginny Weasley and defeating the basilisk within the chamber.

The third book sees Harry dealing with the escape of Sirius Black, who is wrongly accused of betraying Harry's parents. Harry learns the truth about Sirius and Pettigrew, and with the help of a Time Turner, he rescues Sirius and uncovers deeper truths about his past.
